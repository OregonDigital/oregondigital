# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# No coverage crap in the repo!
/coverage

# Ignore local config
/config/app.yml

# Ignore vim swap files
.*.swp

#ignore full item dirs
braceros-tiffs
*_bags

/jetty

# No IDEs
.idea

# Hide compiled assets
/public/assets

# Checked-out directories for set-specific content and assets
#
# Rules:
#
# * We don't want to have anything "real" in app/assets/**/sets
# * We reserve set_content strictly to be the checked-out set repo
# * We ignore app/views/sets knowing that it ignores legitimate files, but to protect things from
#   getting very weird (maybe crashy) if somebody does a "git add ." or similar.
/set_content
/app/assets/javascripts/sets
/app/assets/images/sets
/app/assets/stylesheets/sets
/app/views/sets/*

# Ignore derived images - in production they probably won't live here, but we still don't want
# to accidentally push any up during dev/test
/media
/public/media
/public/thumbnails

# Ignore deploy configuration files for God and Unicorn
# These sit on our production server and are symlinked in.
/config/god.conf
/config/unicorn.rb
/config/puma.rb
# Ignore Vagrant
/.vagrant/*
# Ignore circle ci rspec output
/rspec
